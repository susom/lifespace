        You are invited to participate in a research study on life space, or the space within which people live, work, and recreate. Based on a custom iPhone Life Space application, we will develop individual life space maps (geographic footprint). We will sample Google Street View images from the life space and extract features using computer learning in order to evaluate the association of built environment features with health and well-being. This research study is looking for 120 REGARDS participants to be enrolled. Stanford University expects to enroll 120 research study participants.

Each evening, you will complete a brief survey of three questions. At the end of the data collection period, you will be sent an anonymous survey asking about your experiences using the app.
