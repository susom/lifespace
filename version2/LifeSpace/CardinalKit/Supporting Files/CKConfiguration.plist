			<string>Hi there! 👋🏽</string>
			<key>FormalTitle</key>
			<string>Introduction</string>
			<key>Summary</key>
			<string>This is a pilot study to develop individual life space maps of the geographic footprint where you spend time each day. This data will be collected using the Life Space app.

The app will passively collect your location and will require 5 minutes to complete a survey at the end of each day. You can turn off the app temporarily if you visit a location that you wish to keep private. 

The duration of this study will be two weeks (14 days). At the end of the data collection period you will be sent a survey asking about your experiences using the app; this survey will take less than 10 minutes to complete.</string>

			<key>Summary</key>
			<string>We will collect the coordinates of your location throughout the day along with the time that you were in that location. We will also collect your name and Apple ID. 

Risks: The primary risk is a potential loss of privacy, but we have taken all measures to minimize this risk. If for any reason you do not wish to have your location recorded temporarily, click ‘Stop’ and the location will stop recording until you start it again. Your data are stored securely, and your name and Apple ID will be removed from your data when it is downloaded.

Benefits: We cannot guarantee any benefits to you in this study apart from a deeper understanding of how you have spent your time during the day. We also hope that you will have a sense of satisfaction in participating in an epidemiological study.</string>
